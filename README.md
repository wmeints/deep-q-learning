# Deep Q-Learning Sample
This repository contains the code for the Deep Q-Learning sample shown during my reinforcement learning talk on may 22nd 2019.
Please follow these instructions to run the demo code on your own machine:


## Prerequisites
You'll need the following pieces of software:

 - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
 - [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
 - [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
 - [Atari-py](https://github.com/openai/atari-py)
 - [Torchagent](https://pypi.org/project/torchagent/)
 
Make sure you have a proper graphics card. This sample will eat all your video memory, given enough time.
I would not recommend running this on a CPU in a notebook. Your machine will run quite hot.

## Running the code
Open your favorite terminal and navigate to the root of this repository.
Execute the following command to run the code:

```
python .
```
